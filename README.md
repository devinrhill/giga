# Giga all-purpose engine library
Umm.. I think the most useful feature in this library
is the Bytestream

A Bytestream is a lot like a C++ std::fstream, except
it only operates on a buffer in memory, and behaves as
both a std::ifstream and std::ofstream. I also implemented
helper functions to read from a file and put in the memory buffer,
or to write the memory buffer to a file.
